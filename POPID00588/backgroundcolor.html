    <h1>Color</h1>
    <p>Color is defined as the aspect of things that is caused by differing qualities of light being reflected or
        emitted by them. To see color, you have to have light. When light shines on an object some colors bounce off the
        object and others are absorbed by it. Our eyes only see the colors that are bounced off or reflected. The first
        person to discover the link between color and light was scientist Sir Isaac Newton.</p>
